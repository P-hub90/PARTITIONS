# How to Partition an Empty Drive into 3 Partitions and Format Them with NTFS

## Objective
This guide will show you how to partition an empty disk into three partitions and format them using the **NTFS** file system in **Windows**.

 I found an video that is highly relevant for partitioning an empty drive. You can see the full video: https://youtu.be/Svul8zeXjmw?feature=shared .

## Prerequisites:
- An empty or unallocated disk attached to your computer.
- Administrative privileges to manage disk configurations.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Open Disk Management

1. Right-click on **This PC** and select **Manage**.
2. In the **Computer Management** window, go to **Disk Management** under the **Storage** section.

### Step 2: Locate the Empty Disk
- In the **Disk Management** window, locate the new disk that has **Unallocated** space.
  - The disk will appear as "Disk X" (where X is the disk number) and show "Unallocated" as the status.
  - If the disk is not initialized, you may need to initialize it first (more on that in Step 3).

### Step 3: Initialize the Disk (If Not Already Initialized)
1. If the disk is new and uninitialized, right-click on the **Unallocated** space and select **Initialize Disk**.
2. Choose either the **MBR** (Master Boot Record) or **GPT** (GUID Partition Table) partition style. **GPT** is recommended for modern systems.
3. Click **OK** to initialize the disk.

### Step 4: Create the First Partition
1. Right-click on the **Unallocated** space of the initialized disk and select **New Simple Volume**.
2. In the **New Simple Volume Wizard**, specify the size for the first partition.
   - For example, if you are using a 500 GB disk and want three equal partitions, enter **166,666 MB** (approximately 167 GB) for the first partition.
3. Click **Next**.
4. Assign a drive letter, such as **D:**, and click **Next**.
5. In the **Format Partition** window:
   - Select **NTFS** for the file system.
   - Leave the **Allocation unit size** as **Default**.
   - Enter a **Volume label** (e.g., "Data1") or leave it as the default.
   - Check **Perform a quick format** (optional but faster).
6. Click **Next**, then **Finish**.

### Step 5: Create the Second Partition
1. After the first partition is created, you should see the remaining **Unallocated** space.
2. Right-click on the **Unallocated** space and select **New Simple Volume**.
3. In the **New Simple Volume Wizard**, specify the size for the second partition.
   - For example, enter **166,666 MB** for the second partition.
4. Click **Next**.
5. Assign a drive letter, such as **E:**, and click **Next**.
6. In the **Format Partition** window:
   - Select **NTFS** as the file system.
   - Use the default **Allocation unit size**.
   - Enter a **Volume label** (e.g., "Data2").
7. Click **Next**, then **Finish**.

### Step 6: Create the Third Partition
1. After the second partition is created, the remaining space should now be visible as **Unallocated**.
2. Right-click on the **Unallocated** space and select **New Simple Volume**.
3. In the **New Simple Volume Wizard**, specify the size for the third partition.
   - Enter the remaining space for the third partition (it will be the rest of the disk).
4. Click **Next**.
5. Assign a drive letter, such as **F:**, and click **Next**.
6. In the **Format Partition** window:
   - Select **NTFS** as the file system.
   - Use the default **Allocation unit size**.
   - Enter a **Volume label** (e.g., "Data3").
7. Click **Next**, then **Finish**.

### Step 7: Verify the Partitions
- Once all three partitions are created and formatted, they will appear in **This PC** (or **My Computer**) with the assigned drive letters (e.g., **D:, E:, F:**).
- You can verify the partitions in **Disk Management** by ensuring each partition has a **NTFS** file system and the appropriate size.

### Step 8: Format Additional Partitions (If Needed)
- If any partitions show as **RAW** or unformatted, right-click on the partition in **Disk Management** and select **Format**.
- Select **NTFS** and follow the formatting steps.

## Conclusion
You have successfully partitioned the empty drive into three partitions and formatted them using **NTFS**. These partitions are now ready for use.
